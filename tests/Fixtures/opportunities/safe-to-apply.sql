-- SUMMARY:
--   Total Opportunities: 2
--   ⚠️  Contradictions: 1 (Data violates model expectations - REQUIRES MANUAL REMEDIATION)
--   Recommendations: 1 (New constraints that could be safely applied)
--
-- This script contains 1 safe to apply opportunities.
--
-- IMPORTANT: Never modify OutSystems model JSON files directly.
--            These scripts are suggestions only and will not auto-execute.
-- =============================================================================
-- ========== RECOMMENDATION ==========
-- RECOMMENDATIONS - SAFE TO APPLY
--
-- These opportunities represent NEW constraints that could be safely added to your database.
-- Profiling has confirmed that the existing data already satisfies these constraints.
-- Examples include:
--   • Adding NOT NULL to columns that have no null values
--   • Adding UNIQUE constraints where data has no duplicates
--   • Adding FOREIGN KEY constraints where referential integrity is already maintained
--
-- ACTION: Review and apply these constraints to better align your database with the model.
-- These changes will improve data integrity and help prevent future data quality issues.
-- ---------- Nullability ----------
-- NULLABILITY RECOMMENDATIONS
-- Why this matters: These columns could be made NOT NULL to improve data integrity.
-- Profiling confirms no NULL values exist in the data.
-- What to do: Consider adding NOT NULL constraints to prevent future NULL insertions.
-- Nullability dbo.OSUSR_ABC_CUSTOMER (Email) Category=Recommendation Risk=Low
-- Summary: Enforce NOT NULL constraint.
-- Rationale: Null probe succeeded.
-- Evidence: Nulls=0 (Outcome=Succeeded, Sample=100, Captured=2024-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00)
-- Evidence: Rows=100
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[OSUSR_ABC_CUSTOMER]
