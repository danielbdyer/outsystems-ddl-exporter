Great question. The short version: updating **External Entities** (via Integration Studio) isn’t fundamentally “worse” than normal entity updates, but it **adds one extra producer step** (publish the Extension) and **amplifies the blast radius** if you expose those entities widely. With the right layering, you don’t have to republish “everything all the time.” ([OutSystems Success][1])

| **Internal Entity changed in a shared Data/Core module consumed by others** | Public element (Entity/Structure/Action) in Producer changed | **Producer + any Consumers showing *Outdated References***                                       | Consumers need to refresh their references to the Producer’s new public model before changes are effective at runtime. ([OutSystems Success][3])     |
| **External Entity changed (Integration Studio)**                            | Extension model refreshed and published                      | **Extension + direct consumer modules** (and then **any transitive consumers** that are flagged) | An Extension is a separate Producer. After you publish it, Consumers must refresh/publish to pick up the new public model. ([OutSystems Success][1]) |

Two core mechanics drive the republish need:

1. **Public contract change** → Consumers are marked **Outdated** and must refresh/publish. (Breaking changes cause errors until fixed; additive, non-breaking changes still mark “Outdated” so you can opt-in to the new model.) ([OutSystems Success][4])
2. **Library deployment model** → At runtime each Consumer carries compiled copies of Producer libraries, so you re-publish the Consumer to deploy the updated Producer model into it. ([OutSystems Success][5])

# Will this be a pain point if your data model is highly interrelated?

It **can be**—**if** many modules consume the Extension (or a Data module that publicly exposes lots of entities) **directly**. Highly interrelated schemas + wide exposure = lots of “Outdated References” and frequent republish fan-out. That’s not unique to External Entities—it’s the same rule for any public Producer—but Extensions make the producer/consumer boundary explicit, so you feel it more. ([OutSystems Success][3])

The good news: you can **drastically shrink the blast radius** with a few design moves.

# How to keep republishing from cascading

**1) Quarantine the schema behind a Data Facade (no public entities).**

* Create a **single Data/Core module** that **consumes the Extension**.
* Keep **its Entities *not* Public**. Expose **Service Actions** that return **custom Structures (DTOs)** with **stable shapes**.
* Up-stack (Services/UI) consumes the **Service Actions**, not the raw Entities.
  Result: when External Entities change, you **only** publish the Extension + Data/Core. If your Service Actions’ signatures didn’t change, upper layers won’t even be flagged. ([OutSystems Success][3])

**2) Stabilize the database contract with Views/Synonyms.**
Map External Entities to **SQL Views** (or Synonyms) whose **column list stays stable** during churn; evolve the base tables underneath. You can perform additive changes first, then flip the view definition later. This keeps the **Extension’s visible schema steady**, minimizing Outdated flags. (This is a standard integration pattern; OutSystems happily consumes views as External Entities.) ([OutSystems Success][6])

**3) Prefer additive, backward-compatible migrations.**
Sequence changes as: **add (nullable) → deploy → adopt in code → enforce** (rename/constraint/type changes last). Additive steps mark consumers as Outdated but don’t break; you can batch the consumer publishes on your cadence instead of “constantly.” ([OutSystems Success][4])

**4) Narrow the dependency graph.**
Audit which modules truly need data access. Collapse casual reads into the Service layer that already calls your Data Facade. Fewer consumers → fewer republishes. OutSystems’ own guidance emphasizes exposing only what must be reused. ([OutSystems Success][3])

**5) Publish in **batches** at clear cut points.**
Use **Solutions/Applications** to republish the **Extension + Data/Core** together after a schema wave, then only republish upper layers that are flagged. This keeps operational friction predictable. ([OutSystems Success][2])

**6) Watch your dependency strength.**
Where possible, depend on **Structures/Actions** rather than Entities; this often weakens the coupling so cosmetic entity tweaks don’t ripple up. (See OutSystems’ treatment of strong vs weak dependencies.) ([OutSystems Success][7])

# Practical decision tree (what to republish)

* **You refreshed & published the Extension** → **Publish the Data/Core module(s)** that **directly consume** it (they’ll be Outdated). ([OutSystems Success][1])
* After Data/Core publishes, check apps for **Outdated References**.

  * **If none** at Services/UI: stop.
  * **If flagged**: only publish those flagged modules whose **public contracts actually changed** from their producers. ([OutSystems Success][4])

# Bottom line

* Compared to “normal” internal-entity changes, **External Entities add one producer publish step** (the Extension).
* **Constant republishing** only happens when many modules **directly** depend on the changing contract.
* With a **Data Facade + stable DTOs + view-based contract** and **additive-first migrations**, you’ll typically republish **Extension + Data/Core** and **rarely** touch upper layers. That keeps this from becoming a chronic pain point. ([OutSystems Success][3])

If you want, I can sketch a quick **module map** of your current consumers and propose the minimal facade/DTO set that would collapse the blast radius.
