Totally fair take. If your north star is “**one place of change**” and you want OutSystems to feel almost motionless while the schema evolves fast, the lever isn’t “use views everywhere no matter what.” It’s “**use a contract only where it buys real, compounding risk reduction**—and automate the rest so it doesn’t feel like a second head.”

Below is a concrete, decision-quality way to evaluate the tradeoff, plus a minimal-overhead pattern that keeps Service Studio quiet while you still move the schema quickly.

---

# 1) What you actually pay for—and save—when you use a view

Think of each entity’s surface as a **contract** that many modules depend on. You can expose that contract either:

* **Directly** (bind External Entities to base tables), or
* **Via a view** (bind to `contract.<Entity>` and reshape underneath).

The economics hinge on **how often the shape changes** × **how many consumers depend on it**. A back-of-the-envelope model:

* **Direct bind cost per change** ≈
  (affected modules) × (refresh + republish + fix minutes) × (coordination/merge risk factor).
  In practice: 3–12 modules × 10–30 min = **30–360 min** per change, not counting “oops” cascades.

* **View cost per change** ≈
  edit the view text + (optional adapter refresh) + zero consumer edits if the column list stays stable = **5–20 min**.

If an entity changes shape >1–2 times per quarter **or** has fan-out to 3+ modules, the view wins quickly. If it’s a **leaf** with 1 consumer and low churn, direct is often cheaper.

> TL;DR: Don’t pay “view tax” everywhere. Pay it where the blast radius is real.

# 2) Crisp decision rule: when a view **is** the right tool

Adopt a view up front **only** if an entity hits **any two** of these:

1. **Fan-out**: referenced by multiple modules/pods or public APIs.
2. **Churn risk**: known renames/splits/semantic cleanup coming.
3. **Security shaping**: PII needs masking/column-level ACLs.
4. **Performance shaping**: you expect to denormalize/compute for hot paths.
5. **Ownership boundaries**: cross-team table moves or cross-DB wiring.
6. **Key evolution**: likely to widen or change identity semantics.

Everything else? **Bind direct** and move fast (with guardrails below).

# 3) “Contract-Minimalism”: a pattern that keeps overhead tiny

You can keep **one head** (your base schema) while still insulating the app—without hand-maintaining 200 views.

## 3.1 Generate pass-through views once, not by hand

* Auto-generate explicit-column pass-through views into a `contract` schema for only the entities that trip the rule above (20–40, not 200).
* For everything else, bind **directly** to the table.

> Why explicit columns? It locks the contract. But because the view is pass-through, maintenance is near-zero until you *need* to reshape. Generation is a one-time script; edits are rare and purposeful.

## 3.2 Use “**alias in place**” inside the view to avoid v2 churn

* If you must “rename” a column, **add** the new column in the base and **alias** it back to the old name in the contract view.
* Consumers keep using the old attribute name; **no reference swaps** in Service Studio.
* Only introduce `v2` when you truly need to **remove** the old thing system-wide.

## 3.3 Collapse consumer churn with a service boundary

* Put a **Core Service** module in front of each context.
* UI/feature modules consume **server actions + structures**, not raw External Entities.
* When the database shape shifts, you typically publish **one** service module, not twelve downstream consumers.

Result: you still “manage the schema in one place” (SSDT), and Service Studio doesn’t feel the tremors.

---

# 4) If you want to go **direct-first**, here’s how to do it safely

This is the smallest process that works when you prefer concise, direct evolution:

### 4.1 Hard caps (stopblast)

* **Scope**: direct bind is allowed only for **leaf** entities owned by a single pod.
* **Timebox**: every direct-bound entity has a 30-day expiry; at expiry you either (a) keep it direct and renew *explicitly*, or (b) promote it to a contract view.
* **Fan-out rule**: the moment a second pod wants it, **promote** to a contract view.

### 4.2 Daily refresh window

* One **daily** Integration Studio refresh/publish window (e.g., 12:30–1:00).
* All direct-bind retargets happen **then**, never ad hoc. Keeps the rest of the day calm.

### 4.3 No break-in-place on live consumers

Even direct-first, forbid these unless you’ve promoted to a view first:

* In-place **renames**;
* **Type tightening** or nullability tightening;
* **Dropping** a column still in use.

If you must do any of those, add the new column additively, backfill, and plan a later tidy-up—or promote to a view and alias immediately.

### 4.4 One-touch promotion path (no consumer swaps)

When direct starts to hurt:

1. Add a **contract view** (same column list) above the table.
2. In Integration Studio, **add** the view entity and leave the table entity in place.
3. In a small, scheduled change, **refactor the Core Service** to read via the view (downstream consumers don’t change).
4. Deprecate the table entity reference at leisure.

You’ve just gone from direct to insulated with **one publish** in the service, not across all feature modules.

# 5) “Multiple heads” fear: how to avoid it even with views

You’re right: unmanaged, `v1/v2/v3` sprawl is real overhead. Avoid it with these rules:

* **One contract name per entity** for as long as possible (`contract.Customer`). Prefer **aliasing and additive** evolution inside that name.
* When you truly need a break:

  * Introduce **exactly one new version** (`contract2.Customer` or `v2.Customer`).
  * Put a **sunset date** on the old one at creation time (e.g., “deprecates 60 days after first prod use”).
  * Track in a tiny registry and clean it monthly. You’ll rarely have more than a handful alive at once.

This way, you don’t carry “multiple heads” indefinitely; you carry **one** and occasionally a second for a brief migration window.

---

# 6) Concrete comparisons (felt reality)

**Case A — Customer rename; 6 modules depend on it**

* **Direct-first**: 6 modules × 15–30 min refresh/fix = 1.5–3 hours + coordination risk.
* **Contract-minimal**: add `DisplayName` in base, alias in view → 10 min DB-only change; **0** module work.
* **Net**: views save hours when fan-out ≥3, even counting the “overhead” of having a view file.

**Case B — Leaf table, one module, cosmetic changes**

* **Direct-first**: 15 min in the daily window; no view to maintain.
* **Contract-minimal**: not worth a view yet.
* **Net**: direct wins; promote only when it gains a second consumer or a risky change appears.

**Case C — Split Address out of Customer**

* **Direct-first**: multiple modules break at once; coordinated publish day.
* **Contract-minimal**: keep the old shape in the view via a JOIN; migrate UI gradually; drop the old columns later.
* **Net**: the view avoids a multi-team freeze.

---

# 7) Keep it SSDT-simple (one place of truth)

You don’t need a second system to “manage views.” Keep everything in **one SSDT project**:

* `/Tables/*` — your base schema (the “one place”).
* `/Views/contract/*` — pass-through stubs (generated once for ~30–40 entities).
* `/Views/contract/*` — hand-tuned **only** for the handful that need masking/aliases/joins.
* `/Security/` — DENY base tables in higher envs, GRANT `contract.*` (enforces discipline).
* `/Seeds/` — MERGE static data.
* A tiny **contract test** in CI that fails if `contract.*` accidentally drifts (no `SELECT *`, no unexpected type/nullability changes).

From a maintenance lens, this is still “one place”—just two folders in the same repo.

---

# 8) A pragmatic operating model (what I’d actually run)

1. **Default** = **Direct-first** for leaf, single-consumer, low-risk entities.
2. **Contract-minimal** (= a view) for any entity that is shared, volatile, security-sensitive, or performance-critical.
3. **Core Service boundary** so most UI modules don’t bind EEs directly—this collapses 80–90% of Service Studio churn.
4. **Daily adapter refresh window**; publish order is scripted; no ad-hoc publishes.
5. **Monthly deprecation train** to drop any temporary `contract2` artifacts; keep the garden clean.

You get **fast schema evolution in SSDT** (your “one place”), near-zero churn in Service Studio, and you only pay the “view tax” where it has obvious ROI.

---

## Bottom line

You’re not wrong: if an entity is local, low-risk, and short-lived, **direct and concise** is fastest. But the minute **fan-out, security, or churn** shows up, a **thin contract view** pays for itself—especially if you (a) generate pass-throughs, (b) keep **one** contract name alive as long as possible with aliases, and (c) route most consumers through a core service. That combination preserves your “manage schema in one place” goal **and** keeps Service Studio from becoming a retarget treadmill.
