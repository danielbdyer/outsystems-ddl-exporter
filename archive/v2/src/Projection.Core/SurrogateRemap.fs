// LINT-ALLOW-FILE: validation-error message construction in

// payload is operator-facing audit-trail prose where typed-value
// formatting is the right primitive.

/// pipeline threads anywhere FK values have to cross identity spaces.
/// Two consumers ship today — the Transfer realization (re-point at
/// load time) and the static-artifact emit path (re-point at MERGE-
/// rendering time, the `full-export` consumer) — and the carrier types
/// + apply primitives live here, separate from any one acquisition
/// method. `Reconciliation` (sink-row matching, transfer-flavored) and
/// `UserFkReflowPass` (operator user-matching strategy, V1-shaped) are
/// two acquisition surfaces; they produce evidence in this file's
/// `SurrogateRemapContext` shape, consumed at every emit/realization
/// site through `SurrogateRemap.remapRowFks`.
