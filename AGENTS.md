# Agent Guidelines

- Begin every working session by executing the `notes/run-checklist.md` steps (install/verify .NET 9 SDK, restore, build, test, optional CLI smoke) so the environment is proven green before coding; document any deviations.
- Always consult `tasks.md` at the start of each task to stay aligned with the current execution plan; update it when new work items emerge.
- Revisit `architecture-guardrails.md` whenever making design or implementation decisions to ensure architectural guardrails are upheld.
- Reference the checklist, task backlog, and guardrails in status updates or planning summaries so stakeholders can trace work back to the roadmap and guardrails.
