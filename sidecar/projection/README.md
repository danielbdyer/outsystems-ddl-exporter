# Projection — V2 Pure Core

The pure-F# foundation of the OutSystems DDL exporter, V2. The pure core
lives entirely under `sidecar/projection/`. V1 (the existing C#
implementation in the rest of the trunk) continues to operate; V2 is
additive and will eventually orbit the pure core via an admire-and-extract
migration. The trunk's behavior is unchanged whether the pure core is
present or absent, and every commit here is cherry-pick safe.

## What this is

A faithful implementation of the algebra described in `AXIOMS.md`. A
catalog of identity-keyed kinds, lensed by a four-axis policy and
informed by empirical profile evidence, runs through a factored functor
(`Project = Π ∘ E`) to produce immutable content-addressed snapshots whose
construction makes determinism, lineage, modular composition, refactor
safety, and cross-projection consistency constitutive properties of the
system rather than external disciplines.

The pure core has no I/O, no mutation, and no dependence on time. All
effects live at the boundary, in **F# adapters** (the language partition
was relocated by `DECISIONS 2026-05-09`; the original "F# core / C# shell"
framing has been superseded). Adapters return F# value types the core
consumes. The two-language partition is no longer the algebra/I-O seam;
the seam is structural — `Projection.Core` has zero I/O, adapters do.

## V2 is self-contained; V1 is editorial donor

V2 has **zero runtime dependency on V1's trunk**. No `ProjectReference`,
no V1 assembly on V2's classpath, no wrapper layer between V2 and V1.
V2's source tree is self-consistent; every commit is cherry-pickable
into a V1-only trunk by construction.

V1's relationship to V2 is **editorial**, not structural. V2 reads V1's
source for inspiration and reference, decides what's worth keeping, and
**carbon-copies** the relevant source files into V2's domain-structured
locations. Once a file lands in V2, it is V2's: refactor freely, rename
to V2 vocabulary, restructure to fit V2's idioms. The carbon-copy is
the absorption; from that moment on, V1's evolution and V2's evolution
of the same code diverge at their owners' chosen rhythms.

**Where carbon-copies land** is V2's domain partition, not V1's source
area. If a V1 capability is algebraic, the carbon-copy lands in an
existing F# project (`Projection.Adapters.Osm`, `Projection.Core`,
etc.). If a V1 capability is irreducibly C#-idiomatic — built on
top of `Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo`, `Microsoft.SqlServer.Dac`,
`Microsoft.SqlServer.TransactSql.ScriptDom`, etc. — V2 admits a new
**focused C# adapter project** with **museum-polish** code quality
(e.g., `Projection.Adapters.OssysSql` for SQL extraction if pursued).
The pure F# core remains pure; the C# layer is small, deliberate, and
named for the capability it adapts, not for V1.

**The carbon-copy may land verbatim** (V1 names initially preserved
for review against V1's source; renamed to V2 vocabulary in a
follow-up commit), **or refactored at copy-time** (the file lands
already wearing V2 names and V2 idioms). The choice is pragmatic per
file. Either way, the final state of the file is V2 code, indistinguishable
from code V2 authored from scratch, except that a single **file-header
comment** cites the V1 source for tethering and inspiration:

```fsharp
// Carbon-copied 2026-MM-DD from V1's `src/Osm.Pipeline/.../<File>.cs`
// at the V1 head V2 inherited from. Refactored for V2 vocabulary
// and idioms. See ADMIRE.md entry for the editorial trail.
```

The header comment is one-time and never maintained. It is a citation,
not a synchronization mechanism. The corresponding entry in
`ADMIRE.md` carries the audit trail.

**V1 from V2's perspective is frozen in time** at the V1 head V2 saw
when it inherited. V1's actual ongoing evolution in V1's trunk is V1's
concern alone; V2 aims for parity with the V1 version V2 carbon-copied
from. Subsequent V1 evolution is not automatically tracked; if a V1
fix or feature surfaces that V2 wants, V2 may carbon-copy again (or
edit the existing V2 file deliberately), recording the additional
inheritance event in ADMIRE. The cadence is editorial, not mechanical.

See `BACKLOG.md` § "V1 inheritance log" for the operational ledger of
carbon-copy events; `ADMIRE.md` for the per-V1-component records;
`DECISIONS 2026-05-16 (later) — V2 self-containment + carbon-copy
editorial inheritance` for the codifying entry.

not C# as originally scaffolded; corrects line 85 below; `Projection.Pipeline`
is the canary orchestrator. `src/Projection.Adapters.Sql.ReadSide/`
shipped under `Projection.Adapters.Sql/` per the chapter-3.1 / 3.6
ReadSide work.)

The **`SnapshotRowsets` variant** of `SnapshotSource` shipped at
**chapter 3.2 close (2026-05-10)**, resolving V1's JSON-projection-
lossiness class structurally. Five slices delivered SsKey carriage
at every level, reference rowsets, `EspaceKind` activation (Origin
three-way), `IsSystemEntity` activation (`ModalityMark.SystemOwned`
lift), and cross-source parity tests. See `CHAPTER_3_2_CLOSE.md` for
the substantive synthesis. A1's identity-survives-rename bound is
now operationally unblocked at the OSSYS-adapter boundary.

## What's already shipped (built primitives)

The chapter-1 close (sessions 1–12) plus chapter 2's substantive work
to date have built:

- **The algebraic core** — `Catalog`, `Profile`, `Policy` (four-axis),
  `SsKey` identity, the IR pass framework, `Lineage<'a>`.
- **The Diagnostics writer** (`Projection.Core/Diagnostics.fs`,
  session 14 commit 3) — single-channel writer parallel to Lineage.
  `Lineage<Diagnostics<'a>>` dual-writer composition for passes that
  produce decisions plus observer-relevant findings. The codification
  reached its stability mark at session 16 (heterogeneous third test
  via ForeignKey activation).
- **The strategy-layer codification** at its stability mark (session
  11) — Nullability, UniqueIndex, ForeignKey, CategoricalUniqueness
  all under the codified pattern.
- **Three sibling Π emitters** (SSDT raw text; JSON; Distributions)
  honoring A18 amended.
- **Three boundary adapters** — `Static.fs`, `ProfileSnapshot.fs`,
  `ProfileStatistics.fs` under `Projection.Adapters.Sql`; the OSSYS
  catalog reader under `Projection.Adapters.Osm` (in flight).

The remaining un-built primitive now gating substantive forward work:

  - **`SnapshotRowsets`** — SHIPPED at chapter 3.2 (commits
    `6dab9cd` → `a74b904`; bug fix `0336795`). JSON-projection-
    lossiness class structurally closed; A1 boundary-unblocked.
  - **The pipeline canary** — SHIPPED at chapter 3.1
    (`Projection.Pipeline` F# project; not C# as originally
    scaffolded). Self-validates artifacts against ephemeral docker
    SQL Server before publication. The operator-reality canary
    (50k rows × 300 tables, variegated) is the per-commit + per-
    Stop-hook perf-gate target.

## Three substantive inputs and one temporal dimension

V2 amends the original "three aggregates" framing (A6) to recognize three
substantive inputs:

- **Catalog** is structural truth — what kinds exist. Changes when schema
  changes. Sourced from a Catalog Reader at the boundary (V1's
  `OsmModel`). The OSSYS catalog adapter
  (`src/Projection.Adapters.Osm/CatalogReader.fs`) consumes V1's
  `osm_model.json` shape via the `SnapshotJson` variant of
  `SnapshotSource`; the canonical `SnapshotRowsets` variant
  (operator-decided) lands when sequencing brings it. Original
  chapter-2 backlog framing in `CHAPTER_1_CLOSE.md §2.10` and
  `§4 priority 7`.
- **Policy** is operator intent — **four** orthogonal axes (Selection,
  Emission, Insertion, **Tightening**). Tightening was added per
  `DECISIONS 2026-05-09 — A12 amended again` when the NullabilityEvaluator
  admire surfaced the need. Changes when humans decide.
- **Profile** is empirical evidence — what the data actually shows. Used
  by tightening passes (nullability, FK enforcement, uniqueness inference)
  and by emitters that surface evidence (Distributions). May be empty for
  use cases that need no evidence.

Plus one temporal dimension:

- **Lifecycle** is time — the partial order under which all three evolve.

`Project : (Catalog, Policy, Profile) → Surface`. `E : (Catalog, Policy,
Profile) → EnrichedCatalog`. `Π : EnrichedCatalog → Surface`, where each
`Π` consumes whichever subset of `Catalog × Profile` it needs but never
`Policy` (the load-bearing `A18 amended`, `DECISIONS 2026-05-12`). Three
sibling Π's are operational today: SSDT (`Catalog -> string`), JSON
(`Catalog -> string`), Distributions (`Catalog -> Profile -> string`).

See `AXIOMS.md` for the full system, the V2 amendments, and the new
axioms (A32–A34, T11). Read top-to-bottom; A18's amendment lives at the
bottom of the file and is the load-bearing form.

## The strategy layer

Domain decision logic lives in `Projection.Core/Strategies/` as a named
architectural concern adjacent to the algebraic core (`DECISIONS
2026-05-11 — Strategy layer: a named architectural vector`). The
codification reached its stability mark at session 11 (`DECISIONS
2026-05-13 — Strategy-layer codification reaches stability mark`), having
absorbed three real instances (Nullability, UniqueIndex/ForeignKey,
CategoricalUniqueness) under a coherent shape (per-record decisions keyed
by a single SsKey).

Canonical shape of a strategy module:

1. Pure functions of IR fields; no I/O, no mutable state.
2. A typed function-type alias is the seam:
   `StrategyEvaluator<'context, 'config, 'decision> =
      string -> 'config -> 'context -> Profile -> 'decision`
   (`DECISIONS 2026-05-13 — Generic StrategyEvaluator alias cash-out`).
3. Structured rationale DUs cover the decision space exhaustively.
   Continuous evidence is absorbed by adding variants at meaningful
   inflection points, not by carrying parametric confidence values
   (`DECISIONS 2026-05-13 — Discrete-rationale DUs`).
4. Lineage events fire only on actual decisions; total decisions with
   named-skip variants in the outcome DU.
5. Module name advertises the domain — `<Domain>Rules` suffix.

Pass drivers in `Projection.Core/Passes/` delegate to
`Composition.fanOut` when iterating registered interventions
(`DECISIONS 2026-05-13 — Composition vocabulary cash-out`). Four other
composition primitives (`fallback`, `accumulate`, `wrap`, `lift`) are
codified-but-deferred until a second consumer arrives.

## The rich-profiling vector

`Profile` carries empirical evidence beyond simple null/orphan counts.
Two `AttributeDistribution` variants are operational:

- `Categorical of CategoricalDistribution` — value frequencies with
  truncation as a first-class concern (`VocabularyTruncated` distinct
  from `EvidenceMissing`).
- `Numeric of NumericDistribution` — percentile bundle (Min, P25, P50,
  P75, P95, P99, Max) using `decimal` as the canonical type for
  continuous statistical evidence (`DECISIONS 2026-05-13 — Decimal is
  the default`).

Every distribution carries its invariants via smart constructors
returning `Result<'a>` — the **structural-commitment-via-construction-
validation** principle (`AXIOMS.md`, line 555+). Future evidence types
follow the same template; Faker (synthetic-data Π) is deferred until at
least a third evidence type lands or the limitations of two are
explicitly accepted (`HANDOFF.md`, "What's deferred").

## V1 ↔ V2 vocabulary mapping

The pure core uses general algebraic names (`Kind`, `Module`, `Catalog`)
because the algebra is source-agnostic — it must accommodate OutSystems
metadata today and DACPAC, OData, or other sources later. The
domain-prescriptive names from V1 live at the boundary, in the Catalog
Reader's translation. The mapping:

| V1 (`Osm.Domain`)   | V2 (`Projection.Core`) | Notes                         |
|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `OsmModel`          | `Catalog`              | top-level aggregate           |
| `ModuleModel`       | `Module`               | coproduct cell                |
| `EntityModel`       | `Kind`                 | the schema-level entity type  |
| `AttributeModel`    | `Attribute`            | scalar property of a kind     |
| `RelationshipModel` | `Reference`            | directional FK edge           |
| `EntityName`        | wrapped in `SsKey`     | logical identity, not display |
| `TableName`         | `PhysicalRealization`  | physical projection           |
| `ProfileSnapshot`   | `Profile`              | empirical evidence            |

Identity in V2 is whatever survives V1's most aggressive refactoring. For
OutSystems, that is the logical entity name (`EntityName`), not the
physical table name. When DACPAC support arrives, identity is whatever
DACPAC's most stable identifier is, wrapped in `SsKey`.

## Build and test

From inside `sidecar/projection/`:

    dotnet restore Projection.sln
    dotnet build Projection.sln -c Release --no-restore
    dotnet test Projection.sln -c Release --no-build

V2's solution is independent of the trunk's `OutSystemsModelToSql.sln`.
Either solution builds standalone.

Current baseline: **882 passed, 0 skipped non-canary tests** + ~16
Docker-dependent canary tests (chapter-3.2 close, 2026-05-10).
Build clean under `TreatWarningsAsErrors=true`; lint clean across
27 rules; perf-gate clean against the operator-reality baseline.

## Conventions inherited from the trunk

- .NET 9 SDK pinned to 9.0.305 (matches trunk `global.json`).
- xUnit 2.5.3 + coverlet 6.0.0 for tests (matches trunk packages).
- `Result<'a>` + `ValidationError` for all expected failures; exceptions
  only for true invariant violations (port of
  `src/Osm.Domain/Abstractions/Result.cs`).
- Static `Create` factories returning `Result` for value-object validation.
- Immutable types throughout; F# records and discriminated unions only.

## Conventions specific to V2

- F# core has no I/O, no mutation, no time. F# adapters at the boundary
  return F# value types. The boundary is named, typed, and tested.
- Every transformation pass is a pure function `Catalog -> Lineage<Catalog>`
  (or `(Catalog, Policy, Profile) -> Lineage<Catalog>` when it consumes
  policy or profile evidence).
- Every test that enforces an axiom or theorem names it: e.g.
  `` ``A4: kinds with same SsKey are structurally equal regardless of names`` ``.
  Failing tests point directly at the law they claim to satisfy.
- Identity (`SsKey`) is never used as a string in core code. Names are
  presentation strings only.
- Lineage (`Lineage<'a>`) is foundational provenance — constitutive,
  content-addressable, used for replay and refactor safety. A
  `Diagnostics<'a>` writer carries human-consumable telemetry; the
  dual writer `Lineage<Diagnostics<'a>>` is the pass-with-findings
  shape. Writer codification at chapter-2 stability mark; chapter-3.1
  added writer-fidelity discipline (`LineageDiagnostics.tellDiagnostics`
  and `Lineage.ofValueAndEvents` are the canonical primitives; manual
  record-building forbidden).
- Where V2 deliberately diverges from a V1 contract, the divergence
  surfaces as a `Skip` test stub at the test-file level, not as
  ADMIRE-prose commentary.

## Status at chapter A.4.7' close (2026-05-17; registry becomes load-bearing for execution)

- **1262 non-canary tests passing** + canary tests Docker-gated.
  0 skipped; 0 build warnings under `TreatWarningsAsErrors=true`;
  lint count 13 — unchanged from chapter A.4.7 close baseline.
- **Chapter A.4.7' shipped 8 substantive slices in one ship**
  (α / β / γ / δ / ε / ζ / η / θ): `ComposeState` + `PassChainAdapter`
  + `RegisteredTransforms` + `Compose.project` registry-driven +
  `Compose.runSkeleton` + `TransformRegistry.digest` + `osm emit
  --skeleton-only` CLI + `let run` private across 12 passes + A41
  amended. See `CHAPTER_A_4_7_PRIME_CLOSE.md`.
- **A41 amended (execution totality)**: `Compose.project` consumes
  `RegisteredTransforms.allChainSteps` as the canonical execution
  loop; bypassing the registry is structurally impossible because
  the hand-coded pass sequence has retired.
  L3-CC-Transform-Totality's underwriting tightens from metadata
  totality (chapter A.4.7) to metadata + execution totality
  (Bucket A preserved; backing strengthens).
- **5/5 bidirectional property tests** green: skeleton-purity at
  filter-shape (chapter A.4.7); skeleton-purity at true-execution
  (NEW); overlay-exercise; totality coverage; registry-digest
  round-trip (NEW). The chapter exit gate is met.
- **`let run` private in all 12 pass modules**. Public callable is
  `<Pass>.registered.Run` only. ~308 call sites migrated via
  per-test-file shape-restoring shims (test-private; not a module
  surface). Parallel-exposure transition affordance retired.
- **Manifest carries `registry.digest`** (SHA256 over sorted
  `RegisteredTransforms.all` metadata) for downstream audit
  consumers; perturbation-sensitive + permutation-invariant.
- **CLI exposes `osm emit --skeleton-only`** as the operator-facing
  baseline (binary toggle; per-OverlayAxis flags deferred-with-trigger).

## Status at chapter-4.1.A close arc + 4.1.B in-flight (2026-05-10; joint chapter close ritual ran)

- **840 non-canary tests passing** + ~16 Docker-dependent canary
  tests (skip-if-no-Docker), 0 skipped, 0 build warnings under
  `TreatWarningsAsErrors=true`. Lint clean across **27 rules**.
- **DECISIONS.md supreme operating discipline carries 8 pillars**:
  (1) data-structure-oriented; (2) no string-concat aggressively;
  (3) built-in obligation; (4) FP promised land (≥95% pure);
  (5) coding-style commitments (DDD / point-free / hexagonal /
  hardcore FP); (6) **no V2-internal back-compat paths** —
  refactor fully at time of insight (chapter 3.6 codification);
  (7) **gold-standard library precedence + perf-clause** —
  use-case-specific lib → typed DU → StructuredString → documented
  LINT-ALLOW; every refactor cites perf implications; every
  hot-path function has `Bench.scope` (chapter 3.6 codification);
  (8) **domain-first naming and ubiquitous-language consistency**
  — every named type / function / file embodies the four-question
  domain-naming analysis BEFORE the name is committed (chapter 3.7
  codification).
- **Three named failure modes codified** (chapters 3.7 + 4.1.A close
  arcs): **performance-of-compliance** (LINT-ALLOW shaped like an
  audit trail without substance; pillar 7 amendment),
  **domain-blind naming** (name shaped like a placeholder for an
  absent domain concept; pillar 8), **text-builder-as-first-instinct**
  (StringBuilder reach as default for new emitters; pillar 1 + pillar
  7 amendment; Tier-3 codification this session). Plus
  **infrastructure-blame jumping** (jumps to "X infrastructure is
  unavailable" without verification probe; this session).
- **V2-driver KPI Phase 3 highest-stakes deliverable shipped**:
  CDC-silence-on-idempotent-redeploy canary GREEN under real SQL
  Server 2022 CDC (positive + sensitivity tests; chapter 4.1.B slice
  γ, commit `cdcd953`).
- **Result<'a> aliased to FSharp.Core**: `type Result<'a> =
  Microsoft.FSharp.Core.Result<'a, ValidationError list>`.
  FsToolkit.ErrorHandling 4.18.0 + .TaskResult adopted; `result {}` /
  `taskResult {}` / `validation {}` CEs natively available.
  `DiagnosticSeverity` qualified.
- **Canary scale ceiling**: 500k rows in 27s warm (5 tables × 100k rows
  per table; chapter-3.1 baseline holds).
- **Bench surface**: instrumented across Core / Adapters / Targets /
  Pipeline. Iterator-logging primitives: `Bench.scope` (RAII timing),
  `Bench.iterDo` / `iterMap` / `iteriDo` (per-element samples),
  `Bench.streamProbe` / `streamTransit` (lazy-sequence throughput),
  `Bench.recordSample` (external counters). Pass-entry scopes added
  at every pass `run`.
- **Statistical perf-gate** at `scripts/perf-gate.sh`: per-label
  `μ + Kσ` outlier detection across rolling history (N=20 runs);
  warm-up flat-tolerance fallback. Pre-commit hook runs in ~2s
  warm; soft-skip on missing Docker/dotnet. Stop hook surfaces
  per-message perf summary via `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`.
  Baseline at `bench/baseline-canary.json`.
- **AXIOMS** at A40 (chapter-3.1 cashed A35, A36, A39, A40; partial
  advance on A32; T1 strengthened to statement-stream determinism).

## Pointers

For the next-chapter agent, read in this order:

1. `KICKOFF.md` — 5-minute fresh-agent orientation.
2. `CLAUDE.md` — navigation surface; operating-disciplines table;
   load-bearing commitments.
3. `HANDOFF.md` — bridge letter from chapter-3.1 close; short on purpose.
4. `CHAPTER_3_1_CLOSE.md` — chapter-3.1 close synthesis (sessions
   27–36); four meta-codifications; forward signals.
5. `AUDIT_2026_05_DDD_HEXAGONAL_FP.md` — chapter-close five-agent audit;
   Tier 1/2/3/4 backlog by epistemic level + leverage.
6. `CHAPTER_2_CLOSE.md` — chapter-2 close synthesis (OSSYS adapter; 25
   translation rules; three-class typology).
7. `CHAPTER_1_CLOSE.md` — chapter-1 close synthesis; historical context.
8. `AXIOMS.md` — formal system; A1–A40. A35/A36/A39/A40 are chapter-3.1
   contributions.
9. `DECISIONS.md` — append-only resolution log. The most recent entries
   cover the OSSYS adapter implementation chapter; older entries remain
   in force unless explicitly superseded. An "Active deferrals" index
   at the top tracks deferred decisions with their trigger conditions.
7. `ADMIRE.md` — V1↔V2 bridge; one entry per V1 component admired and
   placed in V2.

This README is updated when the cumulative decisions warrant it (per
the chapter-close ritual codified at `DECISIONS 2026-05-14`); it is
not the source of truth for any specific question.
