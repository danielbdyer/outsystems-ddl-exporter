# THE USE-CASE ONTOLOGY — Obligation Matrix (Pass Four: the test-obligation decomposition)

> **What this is.** One level below the pass-three acceptance suite. Pass three gave *one adversarial
> criterion per cell*; pass four decomposes **each criterion into its full partition of atomic test
> obligations** — the equivalence-class × boundary-value × cross-product expansion — and marks every
> obligation **COVERED / UNCOVERED** against the real test suite at HEAD, citing the test by name and
> line or confirming the absence in code. It turns "is there a discriminating test?" into a **count**:
> *k of n obligations covered* per criterion. The number is the instrument.
>
> **Why it matters — intra-AC phantom-greens.** A criterion pass three marked ✅ PASS can hide
> UNCOVERED obligations beneath it: a cell is green on the happy path but silent on half its
> equivalence classes. Those are *phantom-greens* — the precise place a silent erasure survives behind
> a passing test. §2 is the cross-plane register of every one this pass found. This is the deepest
> level at which completeness is checkable; below it, obligations become individual `[<Fact>]`s.
>
> **Provenance.** Pass one = the target (`THE_USE_CASE_ONTOLOGY.md`); pass two = code mapped onto the
> matrix (`.fitness.md`); pass three = the adversarial acceptance criteria (`.acceptance.md`); **pass
> four = this**, the obligation-level coverage census. Refresh §1's counts as obligations go green.

## 0 — The discernment discipline (read before any grade below)

§§1–6 were graded **test-first**: "a discriminating test is cited → COVERED." That makes the *test*
the authority and silently inherits two failure classes we have now hit in the wild:
- **HOLLOW** — the cited test is green but does not actually discriminate the criterion (the
  phantom-green: e.g. `post > baseline` where the criterion needs exact `= baseline + 2`).
- **silently RED** — the cited test does not even pass at HEAD (the 2026-06-02 VO-leak that red-ed the
  whole `CdcSilenceTests` class while it was cited as COVERED).

**The corrected unit of judgment is the acceptance criterion, not the test.** The criterion is the
subject on trial; it is discerned against **two independent legs of evidence**:
1. **Implemented reality** — does a real production code path do what the criterion demands? (read the
   code, judge it against the criterion's discriminating predicate, *independent of any test*)
2. **Implemented test** — does a test that *runs green at HEAD* actually *assert* that predicate?

**Direction is load-bearing: criterion → {reality, test}, never the other way around.** Do not read a
test and infer what the criterion must be; do not let the implementation define "correct." The
criterion is fixed; code and test are each measured against it. **Two *independent* legs guard against
co-wrongness** — a test written to match the implementation rather than the criterion. Checking
test-against-code (or trusting the test as the criterion's proxy) lets co-wrong code+test agree and
look green; only judging *each leg against the criterion* catches it.

### The grade (supersedes bare COVERED/UNCOVERED)

| Grade | Reality leg (criterion vs code) | Test leg (criterion vs live test) |
|---|---|---|
| **HELD** | satisfies | live-green AND discriminates |
| **CODE-ONLY** | satisfies | none / non-discriminating / not-live → *silent-regression risk* |
| **HOLLOW** | does NOT satisfy (or only weakly) | green but does not truly discriminate → *phantom-green* |
| **NEITHER** | gap | gap |
| **STRUCTURAL** | satisfied by construction (closed DU / smart ctor / type) | no runtime test possible (liveness N-A) |

**Liveness is the test-leg's currency check — necessary, subordinate, and it decays.** A green test
that doesn't discriminate is still HOLLOW; an implementation that passes a test without meeting the
criterion is still HOLLOW. Liveness must be *re-measured* — Docker tests no-op when the daemon is down;
typed-VO lifts introduce `String.Concat` leaks the build cannot catch — so this document carries a
stamp and a re-measure trigger. **The metric is the quality of the discernment, not the count:** the
aggregate % is an inspection upper bound; a cell is only as true as the two-leg judgment behind it.

### Liveness stamp — this refresh

Full suite at HEAD `3c2c854`: **pure 2679 passed / 0 failed / 207 deliberate Skip-stubs; Docker 121
passed / 0 failed / 0 skipped.** No matrix-cited class is in the skip set → **the test leg is verified
live for every cited mark.** The sole silent-RED (`CdcSilenceTests` VO-leak) is fixed. What §§1–6's
COVERED marks have NOT established is the **reality leg** and **discrimination** — supplied by the
criterion-anchored two-leg regrade in §7 below. **Re-measure trigger:** any typed-VO lift, IR change,
Docker-state change, or touch to a cited code path or test.

## 1 — The global obligation scorecard (the count)

422 atomic obligations across the 57 acceptance criteria. ~220 COVERED (52%). Coverage is **not**
uniform — it tracks exactly the gap regions pass two predicted, now quantified:

| Plane | ACs | Obligations | COVERED | Partial | Coverage | Shape |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Identity** (AC-I) | 7 | 45 | 36 | — | **80%** | strongest; refusals + re-point fully witnessed |
| **Provenance** (AC-P) | 9 | 63 | 42 | 4 | **67%** | torsor laws + FTC + live T16 solid; accumulate-leg 0% |
| **Schema** (AC-S) | 12 | 87 | 52 | — | **60%** | facet cross-product (AC-S9 = 25 obligations) thins it |
| **Gates** (AC-G) | 11 | 69 | 35 | 4 | **51%** | only G3/G5/G6 fully wired across verb paths |
| **Proteins** (AC-X) | 8 | 94 | ~35 | many | **37%** | chain-step reachability; data/measure/record legs break |
| **Data/CDC** (AC-D) | 10 | 64 | 20 | — | **31%** | type×null-state cross-product; the deepest hole |
| **Total** | **57** | **422** | **~220** | **~8** | **~52%** | |

**The reading.** The engine is ~80% adversarially proven on identity and ~67% on the schema-algebra/
provenance core, and it thins toward the edges: the **data plane's type cross-product (31%)** and the
**protein composition legs (37%)** are where the most obligations sit uncovered. Crucially, the
*headline* coverage of pass three (~24/57 cells PASS) overstates depth: when each PASS cell is exploded
into obligations, **~30 obligations beneath PASS cells are UNCOVERED** (§2) — the cells are green, the
classes beneath them are not.

---

## 2 — The cross-plane phantom-green register (the crown jewel)

These obligations are UNCOVERED yet sit **under a cell pass three marked ✅ PASS**. Ranked by danger:
how plausibly a wrong-but-named implementation passes today's suite.

### Tier 1 — actively misleading (a passing test for a rejected behavior)

- **OB-I5.3 / AC-I5 (validate-user-map).** `TransferCanaryTests.fs:389` is green and *looks* like
  coverage — but it witnesses the **post-write exit-9**, the exact behavior the criterion rejects in
  favor of a **pre-write halt**. The green test asserts the behavior the spec says is insufficient.
  This is the most dangerous phantom-green in the matrix: it will read as "covered" to anyone not
  decomposing to obligations.

### Tier 2 — a wrong implementation passes the whole suite

- **OB-D4.2–4.5 / AC-D4 + AC-D3 (capture = k).** *Every* CDC assertion in the suite is `post > baseline`
  (an inequality); none pins the exact `post − baseline = 2k`. An unconditional `WHEN MATCHED` MERGE
  (the V1 over-capture shape, capturing all matched rows) satisfies `> baseline` whenever the baseline
  inserted anything. The single highest-value test in the matrix.
- **OB-D1.3 + OB-D1.6–1.15 / AC-D1 (null-safe predicate × type).** The null-safe predicate is proven
  structurally and operationally **for `nvarchar` only**. The 9 other `SqlLiteral` types (int, decimal,
  bit, datetime, date, guid, varbinary) have **zero** null-state-transition tests, yet
  `perColumnChangeDetection` is type-agnostic — a regression in the `SqlLiteral` null-encoding for
  `IntegerLit`/`DecimalLit` breaks null-safe detection for those types with no failing test.
- **OB-P1.4–1.6 / AC-P1 (no-cheat).** The no-cheat law (P-RT₂) is genuinely witnessed on the **kind
  channel only**. Reference, index, and sequence each have a W3 round-trip test but **zero no-cheat
  tests** — a body `applyDiff base d = { …kinds… ; References = target(d).refs; Indexes = target(d).idx;
  Sequences = target(d).seq }` passes every existing C1 test while violating no-cheat on three channels.

### Tier 3 — narrower, lower-probability, but real

- **OB-S9.19 / AC-S9 + OB-P2.8 / AC-P2 (DECIMAL precision+scale).** All 9 facets are compared in code,
  but no test feeds `DECIMAL(10,2)→(18,4)`; a body comparing only `DataType` yields `isEmpty=true` and
  passes both the diff and the round-trip vacuously.
- **OB-I2.11 / AC-I2 (re-key strategies).** PASS covers `MatchByColumn`+`ManualOverride`; the
  `ByEmail`/`BySsKey`/`FallbackToSystemUser` strategies are exercised only at the `UserFkReflowPass`
  layer, never through the `Transfer.runReconciling` execution path (a different, narrower DU).
- **OB-S12.6 / AC-S12 (DacFx-seam).** `isSchemaStatement` is correct by closed-DU match, but no test
  feeds a mixed `CreateTable + AlterTableAlterColumn` stream and asserts the imperative variant is
  excluded — a refactor adding ALTER to the schema branch corrupts the dacpac silently.
- **OB-S4.4/S4.5, OB-S10.3/S10.4, OB-I4.3, OB-D2.4** — stale-token & attribute-level declaration,
  PrimaryKey/Computed refusal, 3-leg composite, nullable-stays-NULL silence: mechanisms correct by
  construction, no adversarial fixture; a narrowing refactor passes.

**The lesson pass four exists to teach:** "✅ PASS" at the cell level is a coverage *claim*; the
obligation count is the coverage *fact*. ~30 obligations beneath green cells are unproven.

## 3 — The gate wiring matrix (10 gates × 3 mutation verbs)

`W` wired-and-fires-before-write · `P` partial (weaker than spec, or some sub-cases) · `–` not wired ·
`ABS` mechanism absent · `N-A` gate inapplicable. (MC = `migrate --execute --conn`; MX = `migrate
--execute --source/--sink-conn`; TR = `transfer --execute`.)

| Gate | MC | MX | TR |
|---|---|---|---|
| G0 `Preflight.all` mandatory | – | – | – |
| G1 Connection | W | W | – |
| G2 Permission | P (db-scope only) | P (sink only) | – |
| G3 Declared-loss DROP | W | W | N-A |
| G4 Delete-scope | ABS | ABS | ABS |
| G5 CDC-tracking | W | W | W |
| G6 CDC-silence-on-idempotence | W | W | W |
| G7 Data-compat NOT-NULL | – (built-not-wired) | – | – |
| G8 Possible-data-loss | P (warn, not refuse) | P | N-A |
| G9 On-disk-bytes (in-place) | ABS | ABS | N-A |
| G10 Transactional/resumable | P (SQL implicit rollback) | P | – |

Only **G3, G5, G6** are fully wired across every applicable path. `transfer --execute` carries **one**
gate (CDC). The master gap is **G0**: `Preflight.all` exists (`Preflight.fs:310`) with **zero callers**,
so the suite is à la carte and a new gate can be added to `all` yet fire nowhere.

## 4 — Protein chain-completeness (the break-points)

Each protein's §3 chain with ✅/✗ per step; `<<<` marks the first break (where the one-command path
stops). Reachable-steps / total in parentheses.

```
P-1/P-2 load (full-export)                                              (3/11)

  Snapshot ✅ → Publish-deploy ✅ → Snapshot-readback ✅ → Diff-roundtrip ✅ →
  Tolerate ✅ → Gate-isEmpty ✅ → Measure-CDC-silence ✗ <<< → Verify-migration ✗
```

**Five load-bearing seams block most chains:** (1) `MigrationRun.record` has zero production callers —
blocks Record on P-1/P-3/P-4/P-6/P-7. (2) No CDC-count read in any CLI verb — blocks Measure on five
proteins. (3) No data-MERGE in the `migrate` path (`executeWithData` passes `Map.empty`) — blocks Move.
(4) No diff-vs-prior in `full-export` — every run is genesis (P-1/P-4). (5) No eject verb / unresolved
fork — P-7 is 0/8.

## 5 — The ordered build-test plan (obligation-level)

### Group 1 — close phantom-greens (pure/Docker tests, **no production code**)

These convert misleading green to real green. Highest ROI; do first.

1. **OB-D4.2–4.5** — assert exact `post − baseline = 2k` for known k (the single most important test).
2. **OB-D1.6–1.15** — nullable fixtures per `SqlLiteral` type (int/decimal/bit/datetime/date/guid/
   varbinary) × null-state transition under live CDC; **OB-D1.3** NULL→NULL silence; **OB-D2.4**
   nullable-stays-NULL.
3. **OB-P1.4–1.6** — no-cheat (base-divergence) tests on the reference/index/sequence channels;
   **OB-P1.2/1.3/1.7** the other base-divergence forms.
4. **OB-S9.19 / OB-P2.8** — `DECIMAL(10,2)→(18,4)` diff + round-trip; **OB-S9.11/13/14/16/17/24** the
   Length-narrow/Precision/Scale/Computed facet cases.
5. **OB-S6.3** simultaneous rename+widen disjointness; **OB-S1.2** name-collision; **OB-S12.6**
   mixed-stream DacFx exclusion; **OB-S4.4/4.5**, **OB-S10.3/10.4**, **OB-I4.3** the construction-correct
   cells; **OB-I2.11** the four strategies through `runReconciling`.

### Group 2 — wire what exists (`built-not-wired`, one call site each, small code)

6. **AC-I5 / OB-I5.1** — build `Preflight.validateUserMap` and gate pre-write (and *replace* the
   misleading post-write test OB-I5.3).
7. **AC-G0 / OB-G0.1-3** — make `Preflight.all` the mandatory entry on MC/MX/**TR**.
8. **AC-G7 / OB-G7.6-8** — wire `tighteningPreflight` into the execute paths.
9. **AC-P8 / OB-P8.4 + AC-X record steps** — call `MigrationRun.record` on `--execute`.
10. **AC-P4.5** — land a production consumer of `compose`/`netDiff`.

### Group 3 — build new mechanism (then test)

11. **AC-S7 / OB-P6.5** reference-rename refactorlog leg (N1); **AC-D5** computed-column exclusion (N2);
    **AC-D6** representation tolerances (N3).
12. **AC-D7 / AC-G4** scoped Delete arm + gate; **AC-D10** wipe-and-load mode; **AC-G9** on-disk-bytes
    probe; **AC-G10** transactional envelope.
13. **AC-P6** refactorlog accumulate-against-prior + real episode clock; **AC-P9** the manifest's
    `ToleranceResidual`/`AppliedTransforms` fields + a consumer; **AC-S8** the `‖rename‖_data=0` canary.
14. **Protein composition** — diff-vs-prior in `full-export` (AC-X1/X3); compose re-key with schema
    migrate (AC-X2); CDC-measure in the CLI verbs (AC-X4/X5/X8); finally **AC-X6 eject** after the
    append-vs-collapse fork is resolved.

## 6 — The full obligation tables (per plane)

The complete per-obligation census follows, one section per plane. Each row: obligation ID · concrete
input (the equivalence-class representative) · expected observable + pass-iff · coverage (test:line or
absence) · why the class is distinct. `N-A` marks obligations inapplicable to a path.

> Sections 6.1–6.6 below carry the full tables. They are the raw instrument; §§1–5 are the read.

— Pass four recorded for the receiving agent. The four passes now compose into a self-measuring
instrument: **target** (the masterwork) → **distance** (the fitness overlay) → **falsifiable test of the
distance** (the acceptance suite) → **the obligation-level census of that test** (this). At any moment
the matrix can state not just which promises are made, but which are adversarially proven, which are
green-but-unproven (the phantom-greens), and which are unbuilt — as a count. Build down §5, refresh
§1's numbers as obligations go green, and the engine's fidelity becomes a measured quantity rather than
an assertion.

---

## 7 — The criterion-anchored two-leg regrade (measured, supersedes the §1 count)

Per the §0 discipline, each of the 57 acceptance criteria was judged **criterion-first** against two
independent legs — implemented reality (the code path, read independent of any test) and the live test
(does the green test actually discriminate). Liveness was verified (full suite green at HEAD `3c2c854`).
This is the measured truth; §1's 52% was an inspection upper bound.

### Global grade scorecard

**Batch 1 landed:** +7 to HELD. Track A closed S1/S9/P1/P2; Track B closed S6 + S12 (STRUCTURAL→HELD)
+ the S10.3/4 sub-gaps; Track C wired `MigrationRun.record` into `migrate --execute --lifecycle-store`
(P8 HOLLOW→HELD; record-leg of proteins X1/X5 advanced, both still HOLLOW pending CDC-measure +
diff-vs-prior).

**Batch 2 landed (HEAD after this commit):** +3 to HELD. Track D — CDC type×null-state sweep (8 types ×
{NULL→value, value→NULL, NULL→NULL}, exact ±2/0) closed **D1 CODE-ONLY→HELD** (spike correction: nullable
columns set `Column.IsNullable=true`, not `IsMandatory`). Track E — narrowing promoted from Warning to a
declared-loss refusal (gated on the existing `allowDrops`) closed **G8 HOLLOW→HELD** and **S11
CODE-ONLY→HELD**. Integration caught real cross-batch blast radius: E's gate refused a narrowing in
Track C's AC-P8 fixture (`verifiedOutcome` now uses `DeclareAll`). Scorecard below is post-Batch-2.

| Plane | HELD | CODE-ONLY | HOLLOW | NEITHER | STRUCTURAL |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Schema (AC-S) | 10 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 |
| Identity (AC-I) | 5 | 1 | 0 | 1 | — |
| Gates (AC-G) | 4 | 3 | 0 | 4 | — |
| Provenance (AC-P) | 6 | 1 | 1 | 1 | — |
| Data/CDC (AC-D) | 3 | 3 | 0 | 4 | — |
| Proteins (AC-X) | 0 | 0 | 6 | 2 | — |
| **Total (57)** | **28** | **8** | **7** | **14** | **0** |

*(Baseline HELD 18 → Batch 1 → 25 → Batch 2 → 28 (49%). CODE-ONLY 15→10→8; HOLLOW 9→8→7.)*

**The reading (post-Batch-2).** Genuinely solid (HELD) = **28 of 57 (49%)** — up from 19 (33%) at the
baseline, *still not* the ~24 PASS the test-first pass implied (those were generous in the wrong cells).
**8 cells (14%) are HOLLOW** — green tests that do not establish the criterion (the phantom-greens).
**10 (18%) are CODE-ONLY** — the code is correct but no test discriminates the criterion's adversarial
input, so a plausible wrong refactor passes the whole suite. **14 (25%) are NEITHER** — genuine gaps.
The HOLLOW mass concentrates exactly where the criteria demand *composed,
operator-reachable* behavior (proteins) or *wired* behavior (gates/provenance) — the places a green
unit/harness test exercises a function in isolation that the production path never composes.

### Per-AC grades

- **Schema:** HELD S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S9, S10, S11, S12 · NEITHER S7, S8. *(Batch 1: S1, S6, S9, S12→HELD. Batch 2: S11 CODE-ONLY→HELD.)*
- **Identity:** HELD I1, I3, I4, **I5** (fixed this session — now genuinely HELD), I6 · CODE-ONLY I2 · NEITHER I7.
- **Gates:** HELD G3, G5, G6, G8 · CODE-ONLY G1, G2, G7 · NEITHER G0, G4, G9, G10. *(Batch 2: G8 HOLLOW→HELD — narrowing now refuses unless declared.)*
- **Provenance:** HELD P1, P2, P3, P5, P7, P8 · CODE-ONLY P4 · HOLLOW P9 · NEITHER P6. *(Batch 1: P1, P2 CODE-ONLY→HELD; P8 HOLLOW→HELD.)*
- **Data/CDC:** HELD D1, D8, D9 · CODE-ONLY D2, D3, D4 · NEITHER D5, D6, D7, D10. *(Batch 2: D1 CODE-ONLY→HELD — 8 types × null-state, exact ±2/0. D2/D3 retain only the MigrationDependencies-emitter live witness; D4 the k>1 exact-count.)*
- **Proteins:** HOLLOW X1, X2, X4, X5, X7, X8 · NEITHER X3, X6.

### The HOLLOW register (7) — green tests that don't establish the criterion (top priority)

| AC | Why hollow | Shared root cause |
|---|---|---|
| ~~**G8** narrowing~~ | **RESOLVED Batch 2** → HELD: narrowing promoted from Warning to a declared-loss refusal (gated on `allowDrops`) | ~~gate emits wrong severity~~ |
| ~~**P8** migrate-records-episode~~ | **RESOLVED Batch 1** → HELD: `record` wired into `migrate --execute --lifecycle-store` via the tested `executeAndRecord`/`recordVerified` seam | ~~record-not-wired~~ |
| **P9** change-manifest | type is *missing* `ToleranceResidual` + `AppliedTransforms`; tests assert only what exists | incomplete type + no consumer |
| **X1** P-1/P-2 load | `full-export` halts at publish; record + CDC-measure tested via harness only | record-not-wired · no-CDC-in-CLI · no-diff-vs-prior |
| **X2** P-3 UAT re-key | `executeWithData` passes `Map.empty`; the canary passes `Map.empty` too — **co-wrong** | **re-key-not-composed** |
| **X4** P-5 redeploy | schema idempotence reachable; CDC=0 measure is harness-only | no-CDC-in-CLI |
| **X5** P-6 in-place migrate | 7/12 schema steps reachable; Move-data + Measure-CDC + Record harness-only | record-not-wired · no-CDC-in-CLI · no-data-leg |
| **X7** P-8 drift | `verify-data` compares two substrates, not deployed-vs-model; test asserts the weaker behavior | no-diff-vs-model |
| **X8** P-9 canary | PhysicalSchema round-trip HELD; CDC-silence measure harness-only | no-CDC-in-CLI |

The protein HOLLOWs are **not 6 independent problems** — they collapse onto four shared seams:
**record-not-wired** (P8 → X1, X5), **no-CDC-count-in-any-CLI-verb** (X1, X4, X5, X8), **re-key-not-
composed** (X2), **no-diff-vs-prior / vs-model** (X1, X3, X7). Fix the seam, lift several cells.

### The CODE-ONLY register (8) — correct but unguarded (a wrong refactor passes the suite)

*Batch 1 closed S1, S6, S9, P1, P2; Batch 2 closed S11 (with G8) and D1.* Remaining — pure-test closers
(no production code): **D2/D3** (only the MigrationDependencies-emitter live witness now missing — the
nullable null-state gaps D2.4/D3.3 closed in Batch 2), **D4** (k>1 exact-count). Wiring/consumer
closers: **G1/G2** (connection/permission on `transfer`), **G7** (tightening on all verbs), **I2**
(ByEmail/BySsKey/Fallback never reach `runReconciling` — a *reality* gap), **P4** (compose has zero
production callers).

---

## 8 — The re-ranked queue (HOLLOW-first, by leverage)

Recovering falsely-claimed value (HOLLOW) and guarding correct-but-unverified code (CODE-ONLY) beats
greenfield (NEITHER). Ordered by ROI = (criterion impact × shared-seam leverage) ÷ (cost × risk).

**✅ Batch 1 complete:** Track A (S1/S9/P1/P2) · Track B (S6/S12 + S10.3/4) · Track C (P8 record-wiring).
+7 to HELD.

**✅ Batch 2 complete:** Track D (CDC type×null-state sweep → D1) · Track E (narrowing declared-loss
refusal → G8 + S11). +3 to HELD; suite green (2694 pure / 145 Docker / 0 fail). Cross-batch blast radius
caught + fixed (E's gate vs Track C's AC-P8 narrowing fixture → `DeclareAll`).

**Next — Batch 2b: Track F** gate wiring (G7 tightening on the execute verbs; G1/G2 connection/permission
on `transfer`; G0 `Preflight.all` mandatory) — Docker-witness-heavy + touches `Program.fs`/`Preflight.fs`/
`TransferRun.fs`, so it runs **solo** (Docker free now that D is done). Then **Batch 3**: protein
composition (the shared seams — CDC-measure-in-CLI lifts X4/X8/X1/X5; re-key compose X2; diff-vs-prior/
model X1/X3/X7) + remaining NEITHER mechanisms + the two remaining HOLLOWs (P9 manifest fields; the
protein cells). **Integration discipline (learned Batch 1–2):** worktree subagents must report
diffs/snippets to apply onto HEAD — wholesale file copies revert recent work when the worktree base drifts.

**Round 5–6 forks — RESOLVED (operator, this session):**
- **Eject (X6): append-forever.** The terminal bundle preserves every episode + the full accumulated
  refactorlog; any prior state is reconstructable (a downstream consumer may DacFx-publish an
  intermediate pre-freeze state). No collapse at freeze.
- **Refactorlog accumulation (P6 + X3): engine-input.** The engine reads the prior committed
  `.refactorlog` at emit time and accumulates/dedups against it by `OperationKey`, and threads the
  *real* episode clock (retire the pinned `2000-01-01` constant). The engine owns the merged log
  (not repo-merge-time).
- **Crash safety (G10): resumable/idempotent.** A mid-load failure is recoverable by re-running the
  same command (idempotent upsert + phase tracking) — not a single all-or-nothing transaction
  envelope, not document-only.
- **Wipe-and-load (D10): explicit named mode.** Build a named `EmissionMode` the operator selects;
  document the `2·|table|` CDC cost; gate it like other destructive ops. Incremental MERGE stays the
  default. (Not the PROD-empty default; not deferred.)
- **Protein composition (X1/X2/X4/X5/X7/X8), G9, I7 — build per the criteria** by *extending existing
  verbs* (migrate grows measure+record legs; full-export grows diff-vs-prior; a deployed-vs-model
  drift check), not new verbs, unless the operator redirects.

**Tier A — convert HOLLOW→HELD with a small wiring fix (highest ROI):**
1. **P8 — wire `MigrationRun.record` into `runMigrateExecute`** (+ a test asserting the CLI persists the
   episode). Same shape as this session's AC-I5 fix (function exists & is tested; one call site). Lifts
   P8 *and* the record-leg of proteins X1/X5. (Recon caveat: confirm the store-path argument/convention.)
2. **G8 — promote the narrowing `Warning` to a declared-loss refusal** (mirror the G3 gate). Converts the
   one gate HOLLOW to HELD; small.

**Tier B — close CODE-ONLY with pure/Docker tests (no production code; `runScenario` now fixed):**
3. Schema adversarial pure tests: **S6.3** (rename+widen disjoint — do first, highest refactor-risk),
   **S9.19** (DECIMAL), **S1.2** (name-collision), **S12.6** (mixed-stream), **S10.3/4** (PK/Computed).
4. **P1** no-cheat tests on the reference/index/sequence channels; **P2.8** DECIMAL round-trip.
5. **D1** type×null-state CDC sweep (the 9 untested types) + **D4** k>1 exact-count — now unblocked.

**Tier C — wire built-not-wired gates (small–medium code):**
6. **G7** tightening into `migrate --execute` (recon already scoped); then **G1/G2** connection/permission
   into `runTransfer`; then **G0** make `Preflight.all` the mandatory entry on all three verbs.
7. **I2** route the three user-match strategies through `runReconciling`; **P4** land a compose consumer.

**Tier D — build new mechanism / compose the protein chains (larger; shared-seam order):**
8. **no-CDC-count-in-CLI** seam → lifts X4, X8, and the measure-leg of X1/X5. **re-key compose** (X2:
   thread a non-empty reconciliation through `executeWithData`). **diff-vs-prior/model** (X1, X3, X7).
9. The remaining NEITHER mechanisms: S7 (reference-rename refactorlog), S8 (rename-CDC canary), D5
   (computed exclusion), D6 (representation tolerances), D7/G4 (delete-scope), D10 (wipe-and-load), G9
   (on-disk probe), G10 (transactional), P6 (refactorlog accumulate + real clock), I7 (rename+reconcile
   compose), X6 (eject — after the append-vs-collapse fork is resolved).

**The single highest-leverage next move:** Tier A #1 (wire `record`) — it is a one-call-site fix that
flips a HOLLOW to HELD and simultaneously advances two protein cells, exactly the shared-seam leverage
the regrade exposed.

---

— Five passes now compose: **target** (masterwork) → **distance** (fitness) → **falsifiable test of the
distance** (acceptance) → **obligation census** (§§1–6) → **criterion-anchored two-leg grade** (§§0,7).
The instrument no longer asserts coverage; it measures it, against the criterion, on two independent
legs, with a liveness stamp that must be re-earned. Refresh §7's grades whenever a code path or test
changes; re-run the liveness stamp after any typed-VO lift, IR change, or Docker-state change.
