/// Chapter A.4.7 slice ε — strategy `RegisteredTransformMetadata`
/// surface for the registered-intervention pass strategies. Each
/// pass strategy (NullabilityRules, UniqueIndexRules, ForeignKeyRules,
/// CategoricalUniquenessRules, CycleResolution) is metadata-only —
/// strategies aren't independently callable (they're invoked via
/// `Composition.fanOut` from inside the host pass module), so the
/// `RegisteredTransform<'In, 'Out>` typed shell with `Run` field
/// doesn't fit.
///
/// **Compile-order rationale.** Strategy outcome types
/// (`NullabilityOutcome`, `UniqueIndexOutcome`, etc.) are referenced
/// by `Lineage.fs`'s `AnnotationDetail` DU, so the strategy modules
/// must compile before `Lineage.fs` + `TransformRegistry.fs`. The
/// strategy modules themselves therefore cannot embed
/// `let registeredMetadata` directly — the `RegisteredTransformMetadata`
/// type isn't in scope at that compile point. This file lives after
/// `TransformRegistry.fs` and packages the strategy registrations as
/// per-strategy values in one collection.
///
/// **Registration granularity.** Per the chapter A.4.7 open Q7 + the
/// chapter-open's anti-scope clause: registry classification is at
/// the strategy-decision level (not sub-strategy fanOut level).
/// `<Strategy>.evaluate` is the conceptual unit; the per-rule
/// classifications (per-`KeepReason` variant within a strategy) are
/// intra-strategy detail not exposed structurally. The Sites list
/// captures the strategy's classification + harvest-discipline
/// rationale.
