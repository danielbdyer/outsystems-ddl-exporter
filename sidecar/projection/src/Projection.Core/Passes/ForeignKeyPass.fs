///     fan-out, decision accumulation, lineage emission.
///   - **Domain seam.** Calls into `ForeignKeyRules.evaluate`; the
///     pass knows nothing about cross-schema gates, orphan handling,
///     or NoCheck logic.
///   - **Per-reference granularity.** The third structural granularity
///     after per-attribute (Nullability) and per-index (UniqueIndex);
