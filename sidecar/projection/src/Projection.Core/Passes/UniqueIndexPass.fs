/// The UniqueIndexPass — V1 `UniqueIndexDecisionOrchestrator` migrated
/// as a pure F# pass producing an emitter-consumable
/// `UniqueIndexDecisionSet` (per A32). The catalog itself is unchanged
/// — uniqueness decisions are metadata that emitters consume; the
/// catalog's structural truth (`Index.IsUnique`) stays the source.
///
/// **Algebra/domain separation (per the session-7 reminder).** This
/// module is the *algebra* layer: registry-iteration over registered
/// `UniqueIndex` interventions, walking each kind × index × intervention,
/// accumulating decisions, emitting lineage events. The per-decision
/// logic — which signals fire, which thresholds apply, what rationale
/// to attach — lives in `UniqueIndexRules`. The pass calls into the
/// rules module via the typed seam (`UniqueIndexRules.evaluate`); the
/// pass knows nothing about the policy reasoning.
///
/// **Per-index granularity (the structural divergence from
/// NullabilityPass).** NullabilityPass walks attributes; UniqueIndexPass
/// walks indexes. The closed-DU `TighteningIntervention` seam handles
/// this naturally: each pass filters to its own variant and uses its
/// own iteration shape. The dispatcher (the orchestrator that calls
/// both passes when both intervention types are registered) lives at
/// the call site, not inside either pass.
///

/// empty `TighteningPolicy.Interventions` (or one with no UniqueIndex
/// variants) yields the empty `UniqueIndexDecisionSet` with no lineage
