/// Vocabulary of the bidirectional control plane (Transfer prescope —
/// `PRESCOPE_TRANSFER.md`). The pipeline mediates between a logical
/// `Catalog` (the schema contract) and physical database substrates.
/// **Projection** lowers the Catalog (and rows) onto a substrate; its
/// named peer **Ingestion** lifts a substrate back into the Catalog
/// (and rows). A **Transfer** composes an Ingestion from a `Source`
/// substrate with a Projection onto a `Sink` substrate, governed by
/// one shared Catalog contract. No direction is canonical: today's
/// export and a staging→UAT load are both Transfers — only the bound
/// adapters differ.
///
/// This file carries the Transfer-specific **apparatus**: substrate
/// roles, the environment + connection-reference vocabulary, and the
/// `TransferConnections` set. The generic identity-domain primitives
/// (`SurrogateRemapContext`, `IdentityDisposition`, `SourceKey` /
/// `AssignedKey`) live in `SurrogateRemap.fs` so emitters can consume
/// the remap evidence without taking a conceptual dependency on the
/// Transfer flow.

/// The flow-relative role a database substrate plays in a Transfer. A
/// substrate is never intrinsically a source or a sink; it is bound to
/// a role per flow (staging is a `Sink` during export, a `Source`
/// during a staging→UAT load). Mirrors the canary's `Source_`/`Target_`
/// ephemeral databases — role, not identity.
