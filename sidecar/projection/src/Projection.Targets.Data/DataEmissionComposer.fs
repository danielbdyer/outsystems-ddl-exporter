/// Π_Data composer (chapter 4.1.B slice η). The dispatch layer that
/// reads `Policy.Emission.DataComposition` and selects which data
/// emitters fire — preserving A18 amended ("emitters cannot consume
/// `Policy`") at the structural level: each emitter signature
/// literally cannot type-check with a `Policy` parameter; only this
/// composer reads `Policy`, and it routes through emitters that
/// consume the `Catalog × Profile (× boundary-supplied evidence)`
/// shape.
///
/// **Slice η scope.** The composer ships with `StaticSeedsEmitter`
/// as its sole real consumer. `MigrationDependenciesEmitter` (slice
/// ε) and `BootstrapEmitter` (slice ζ) are not yet built; the
/// composer treats them as no-op stubs (empty `ArtifactByKind`
/// slices keyed by every catalog kind to preserve T11). When ε / ζ
/// land, the composer adds their dispatch branches without changing
/// its signature.
///
/// **Hoisted `TopologicalOrderPass`.** Per the slice-δ improvement
/// surface (post-commit summary), the composer is the natural home
/// for the pass invocation. Each emitter previously ran the pass
/// internally; now the composer runs it once and threads the result
/// through `emitWithTopo`. The lineage trail of the pass is
/// preserved at the composer surface (returned from `composeWith
/// Lineage`); the convenience `compose` form silently discards the
/// trail (mirroring the pre-composer per-emitter behavior) for
/// callers that don't need it.
///
/// **Per-axis correctness for multi-kind cycles** (the slice-δ open
/// item). Pre-composer, slice δ's per-kind `Rendered` was deploy-
/// correct only for self-FK cycles; multi-kind cycles required
/// global Phase-1-then-Phase-2 ordering across emitters. The
/// composer is where that global ordering would land. **Slice η
/// MVP scope: the global ordering is structurally enabled (every
/// emitter outputs `Phase1Merges + Phase2Updates` separately;
/// composer can interleave) but not yet REIFIED — the per-kind
/// `Rendered` is the only consumer-visible output today.** Slice ε
/// (Migration) is the natural trigger for reifying the global
/// `Phase1 ⨄ Phase2` interleave — at that point a sibling
/// `composeRendered` (or similar) lifts the per-kind text into a
/// pipeline-level concatenation respecting the global phase
/// boundary.
