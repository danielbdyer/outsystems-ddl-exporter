// UserRemapContext (chapter 4.2 slice γ refinement of chapter 4.1.B
// slice ζ placeholder).
//
// At chapter 4.1.B slice ζ this file defined a placeholder `Map<SsKey,
// Map<int64, int64>>` shape for `UserRemapContext`; chapter 4.2 slice γ
// refines it to a typed record (`{ Mapping; Unmatched; Diagnostics }`)
// living in `Projection.Core/UserRemap.fs`. This emitter now imports
// the Core type; the slice ζ MVP behavior (every kind a no-op artifact;
// `UserRemapContext.empty` pass-through) is preserved.
//
// The discovery pass that POPULATES `UserRemapContext` lands at
// chapter 4.2 slice δ (`UserFkReflowPass.discover`); the emitter
// integration that CONSUMES the populated context at row-emission
// time lands at chapter 4.2 slice η.

/// Π_Bootstrap — chapter 4.1.B slice ζ emitter. Per pre-scope §2.3:
/// "Bootstrap emits inserts for system users, default policies, and
/// any remaining-by-policy kinds whose data is not in StaticSeeds or
/// MigrationDependencies."
///
/// **Slice ζ MVP scope.** The emitter ships structurally — type
/// signature, composer integration, T11 keyset coverage — but emits
/// no rows today. The data sources Bootstrap needs (system-user
/// fixtures, default-policy snapshots, profile-attached row data)
/// land at chapters 4.2 + 4.3 when those consumers materialize. Per
/// IR-grows-under-evidence, the structural hook lands now (so the
/// composer's dispatch tree completes); the actual content fills in
/// as consumer-driven evidence surfaces.
///
/// **Why ship the stub now.** The slice η composer dispatches
/// through three sibling positions; pre-ζ the third position was a
/// `emptyArtifact` no-op directly inside the composer. Lifting the
/// stub into a named emitter module (a) gives chapters 4.2 / 4.3 a
/// fixed insertion point, (b) makes the slice θ partition assertion
/// honest (the composer asks Bootstrap for its coverage rather than
/// silently knowing it's empty), and (c) preserves T11 + A18 amended
/// at the structural level for the third sibling.
///
/// **A18 amended.** Signature carries `Catalog × Profile ×
/// UserRemapContext`; never `Policy`. The composer
/// (`DataEmissionComposer`) reads `Policy.Emission.DataComposition`
/// and chooses whether this emitter fires.
