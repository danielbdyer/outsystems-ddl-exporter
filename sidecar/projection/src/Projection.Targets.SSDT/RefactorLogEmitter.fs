/// Π_RefactorLog — chapter 3.5 substantive deliverable. The fourth
/// sibling Π. Consumes a `CatalogDiff` (per `EmitterOverDiff
/// <'element>` declared at `Types.fs:62-63`) and produces typed
/// refactor-log entries — the structural input to SSDT's
/// `.refactorlog` XML document that DacFx's incremental deploy
/// planner reads to convert `DROP COLUMN` + `ADD COLUMN` into
/// `sp_rename`.
///
/// First-slice scope: kind-level renames (i.e., table renames in
/// SSDT vocabulary). The `CatalogDiff` is kind-level (per chapter
/// 3.5 prescope §2 first-slice scope); each `Renamed` entry produces
/// one `RefactorLogEntry` of `ElementType = SqlTable`. Column-level
/// renames defer to a follow-on slice gated on `CatalogDiff` carrying
/// attribute-level keys (the closed-DU empirical-test discipline
/// applies — adding `SqlSimpleColumn` exercises the variant only at
/// match sites within this module).
///
/// **Per A35 / T11 amended again (diff-typed inputs)**: T11
/// (sibling-Π commutativity) extends to diff-typed inputs by typing
/// `ArtifactByKind` over the diff's *target* Catalog. Every kind in
/// the target is in the artifact's keyset; renamed kinds carry
/// non-empty entry lists; everything else carries the empty list.
/// The chapter 3.5 close cashes the amendment.
///
/// **Per A18**: the emitter consumes `CatalogDiff` (which carries
/// `Source: Catalog` and `Target: Catalog` as fields) — never
/// `Policy`. Catalog and Profile are evidence; Policy is intent.

/// SSDT-native operation kind. The `.refactorlog` XML format
/// supports several refactor kinds (`RenameRefactor`,
/// `MoveSchemaRefactor`, `WildcardExpansionRefactor`,
/// `ChangeColumnTypeRefactor`); chapter 3.5 first slice ships
/// `RenameRefactor` only. New variants land under closed-DU
/// expansion empirical-test discipline when a real consumer
/// surfaces them.
