// Construction-arg records for the data-statement builders. Hoisted ahead of
// `Statement.fs` so the typed `Statement` stream can model MERGE / UPDATE (the
// `Statement.Merge` / `Statement.Update` variants carry these); the `build*`
// functions that consume them stay in `ScriptDomBuild`. Previously defined
// inside `module ScriptDomBuild`, which compiles AFTER `Statement.fs` — the
// compile-order wall that kept the data lane on per-emitter string rendering.
// Namespace-level (not in a module) so consumers that `open Projection.Targets
// .SSDT` construct them with bare field labels, exactly as they do `ColumnDef`
// / `ForeignKeyDef` from `Statement.fs`.

/// Declares the scope within which a `WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE THEN DELETE`
/// arm is permitted to delete. AC-D7 / AC-G4: an unscoped delete cannot happen —
/// the ONLY way to get a DELETE arm is to pass a `DeleteScope`. The scope
/// predicate gates eligibility: a target row not matched by any source row is
/// deleted ONLY when it ALSO satisfies the scope predicate; rows outside the
/// scope (in T−S but not in the scope) survive.
///
/// `terms` is a NON-EMPTY list of `(column, value)` equality terms over the
/// MERGE target (e.g. a tenant / partition gate), folded left-to-right with
/// `AND` into the predicate `Target.[col1] = <v1> [AND Target.[col2] = <v2> …]`.
/// Decoupled from ScriptDom so the scope is expressible from domain code.
///
/// Non-emptiness is enforced by the private field + `DeleteScope.create` smart
/// constructor: a scope with zero terms is not a scope — per AC-D7 it must never
/// degrade into an UNSCOPED delete, and `deleteScopePredicate`'s left-fold has no
/// identity for `[]`. `create` returns `None` for an empty term list, exactly the
/// faithful "no delete arm" semantics `DeleteScopePolicy.resolveFor` already
/// produces. The old public record permitted `{ Terms = [] }` — a representable
/// illegal state that would crash the fold; this makes it unconstructable.
