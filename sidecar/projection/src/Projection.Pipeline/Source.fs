/// Frontier base — the capability-typed input boundary. A `Source` resolves a
/// `Catalog` from somewhere (a snapshot file, an inline JSON model, a live
/// connection), and **declares what it can do**. The discriminating predicate
/// lives in the type, exactly as `Comparison.Apply` does: a capability IS the
/// presence of its function — `AcquireProfile = Some f` iff the source can
/// profile; `None` for a snapshot. A consumer that needs profiling pattern-
/// matches `profile src` and finds `None` for a snapshot, so asking a static
/// model to profile is structurally impossible, not a runtime failure.
///
/// This SUPPORTS live OSSYS (a `Source` with the live capabilities) without
/// completing it — the live *adapter* is the verb; this is the port it plugs
/// into. `CatalogReader.SnapshotSource` is the seed it generalizes.
