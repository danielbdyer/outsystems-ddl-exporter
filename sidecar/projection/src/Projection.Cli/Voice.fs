/// (`THE_VOICE.md` is this layer's spec; `THE_VOICE_INTEGRATION.md` §5/§8 is the
/// shape; `DECISIONS 2026-06-06`). The **Voice** layer is the projection
/// `Code → operator copy`, keyed centrally — the boundary-side sibling of the
/// engine's ubiquitous language. A site emits a *coded event* (a `Code` + typed
/// payload, no prose); the **copy** is declared here, harvested into `all`,
/// consumed by the renderer (`TtyRenderer`), and held honest by the `code ⇔ copy`
/// totality test (`VoiceTotalityTests` — the sibling of `registered ⇔ executed`).
/// Inline prose welded to control flow (`sprintf` mid-fold) is forbidden; Voice
/// is concern-shaped (a sibling of Lineage / Diagnostics / Bench / Registry) yet
/// has **no runtime write side** — the declarations are static copy data,
/// projected at render.
///
/// **Scope (slice 1 + the slice-2 stage scaffold).** This voices the flat codes
/// that **already** fire — the lifecycle spine (`config.*`, `summary.*`), the
/// round-trip-verification verdict (`canary.*`), the per-stage Watch lines
/// (`extract/profile/emit.started/.completed`, `summary.stageCompleted`), and the
/// `pipeline.config.*` error family — derived from `THE_VOICE.md`, no new events
/// (IR grows under evidence). This is hybrid §5 mechanism 2 — the code-keyed
/// declarative catalog. The payload-shaped move / gate / proof surfaces (the
/// eleven moves §4, the gates §5, the proofs §6) take mechanism 1 (typed `toView`
/// beside their boundary projections in `EventProjection` / `TtyRenderer`) in a
/// later slice; the streaming Watch render path (§13) + the run unification are
/// the rest of slice 2.
///
/// **Pure-Core passes are voiced by a 1:1 projection-layer companion**, not in
/// `Projection.Core` (`DECISIONS 2026-06-06` Core-purity sub-call, resolved
/// 2026-06-06): `Voice.<Pass> ↔ <Pass>`. No such companion is needed yet — the

/// pure-Core pass lift is the deferred slice-5 `DiagnosticEntry.Message` work.
///
/// **The twelve rules govern every string here** (`THE_VOICE.md` §1 + the banned
