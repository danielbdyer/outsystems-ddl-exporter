module Projection.Cli.Theme

/// The design-system module (`REPORTING_HORIZON.md` — the polish tier). One
/// place for the visual language — glyphs, semantic color, meters, sparklines
/// — so every operator surface (verdict panel, readiness board, digest, diff)
/// reads as one product. Two disciplines ride here:
///   - **Color is meaning, never decoration** — a glyph always accompanies
///     color, so the signal survives a colorblind reader or `NO_COLOR`.
///   - **Universal vs. styled** — glyphs / meters / sparklines are plain
///     Unicode (render anywhere); the `green`/`red`/… helpers emit Spectre
///     markup for the pretty channel only.
